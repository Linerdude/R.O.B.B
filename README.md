# Repair On Board Bot - ROBB
Code repo for BYU Robotics Advanced Team competing in USU's SpaceBot competion 2024. Project comprises building a 6-DOF robotic arm, contolled by ROS noetic via a remote station.

The purpose of this repo is allow for version control and for an easier method to get code onto the raspberry pi controlling the bot. Contact me if you or someone you knows wants to know how to apply this project or has questions, I would be happy to help.
